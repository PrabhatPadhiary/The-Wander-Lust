            <div class="main-content">
                <p><span class="capital">W</span>hat sets Tulum apart is its proximity to some of the most stunning
                    Mayan ruins in all of Mexico: it is here that one of the world’s best cultural destinations meets
                    one of the world’s best beaches. Tulum’s ruin is an ancient walled city sitting on rocky cliff that
                    overlooks a spectacular beach. With hordes of tourists visiting every day, the area is not exactly
                    private, but the broad stretch of white sand and mesmerizing turquoise Caribbean waters more than
                    make up for it.
                    <br>
                    The Riviera Maya is comprised of the area just south of the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
                    It stretches along 75 miles of the Mexican Caribbean coastline in the southeastern part of of the
                    Yucatan Peninsula. The weather is ideal; beautiful white sandy beaches and crystal clear blue waters
                    make for a perfect vacation destination. The term Riviera Maya is fairly new and has varied
                    definitions, but it starts approximately 10 miles south of Cancun at the seaside village of Puerto
                    Morelos and includes places like Playa del Carmen, Puerto Aventuras, Akumal, and Tulum. It ends at
                    the town of Carrillo Puerto.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">T</span>he Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale all-inclusive resorts and
                    a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants
                    available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been
                    instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only
                    represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.
                    <br>
                    Activities at the most visited locations include jet-skiing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming in
                    cenotes, swimming with dolphins, zip-lining, horse riding, sailing, and guided jungle tours.
                    Archeology is also a big tourist draw in the area, including the popular archeological sites
                    operated by the Instituto Nacional de Archeological such as Tulum on the coast, and Chichen Itza and
                    Coba located some distance inland. The self-named ecoparks of Xcaret and Xel-Ha also include some
                    smaller archeological ruins as part of their attractions, but these natural water theme parks
                    operated by private business consortia attract much larger crowds due to the diversity and range of
                    activities provided, such as swimming with captive dolphins.

            <div class="main-content">
                <p><span class="capital">N</span>avagio beach is an isolated yet strikingly beautiful sandy cove on the
                    Greek island of Zakynthos. It is often referred to as the Shipwreck Beach because it is home to the
                    wreck of a ship called Panagiotis that is believed to have been a smugglers ship. The area is
                    defined by its sheer limestone cliffs, white sand beaches, and clear blue water, which attract
                    thousands of tourists yearly. The strip of beach is accessed only by boat, but you can see it from
                    above if you stand on the high side of the surrounding cliffs.
                    <br>
                    The island of Zakynthos off the southwest coast of Greece is one of the country’s quieter islands.
                    However it has one particularly incredible highlight called Navagio Beach (also known as Shipwreck
                    Beach). A sandy little cove surrounded by towering limestone cliffs — plus the rusting remains of an
                    old shipwreck.

                    This stunning Greek beach surrounded by brilliant blue ocean water is an Instagram favorite, and
                    many travelers include Zakynthos on their itinerary specifically to visit this amazing beach in
                    Greece.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">T</span>he most popular postcard photos of Shipwreck Beach come from the top of
                    the 200 meter (650 ft) tall cliffs that overlook it, rather than on the beach itself. While the
                    beach is awesome to visit in person, the views from the cliffs are much more spectacular.

                    However keep in mind that Navagio beach is located on another side of the island from the capital
                    city of Zakynthos (same name as the island). So the best way to get out there is to either rent a
                    car, like we did, or find a tour company that will take you out there in a van. It’s also possible
                    to hire a taxi from the capital, but it will cost around €100 EURO round trip.

                    The drive from Zakynthos town out to Navagio Beach takes about 45 minutes. Once there, you’ll head
                    down an entrance road to the parking area, where there are a few stalls selling food, ice cream,
                    drinks, and souvenirs.

            <div class="main-content">
                <p><span class="capital">T</span>HE WORLD-FAMOUS GRACE BAY BEACH is located on the northeast coast of
                    the island of Providenciales. This pristine beach is the hallmark of the Turks and Caicos Islands,
                    and the recipient of many designations, awards, and accolades.

                    Many sources cite Grace Bay as being seven or 12 miles long (19 km), yet in reality it’s only a
                    little over three miles long (4.8 km). On its east side, Grace Bay Beach continues as Leeward Beach,
                    and on the west end as the Bight Beach. It’s possible to walk the entire seven miles from Leeward
                    Going Through Point (also known as Emerald Point) near Little Water Cay, to Turtle Cove Marina and
                    Smith's Reef. The inlet canals of Turtle Cove Marina and the residential neighborhood of Thompson
                    Cove, and a few outcrops of limestone ocean cliffs near Blue Mountain interrupt the beach, which
                    would otherwise continue another seven and a half mile (12 km) past Blue Hills, Wheeland, and
                    finally to Northwest Point and the Northwest Point National Park.
                    <br>
                    Grace Bay Beach is part of the Princess Alexandra National Park, which also includes the Bight
                    Beach, Smith’s Reef, the Bight Reef (Coral Gardens), Leeward Beach, Little Water Cay, Half Moon Bay,
                    and the eco-tour destination of Mangrove Cay.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">W</span>ant to watch a glorious sunset or capture the perfect photo? As may be
                    expected, the sunset over Grace Bay can be amazing. Some great places to watch the show include the
                    dock at Ricky’s restaurant (the Sandcastles beach access), located on the eastern side of Club Med,
                    and at the Forbes Point beach access near the Sands Resort. The Stubb’s Point (also known as Pelican
                    Beach or Sunset Beach) access on Leeward Beach is another great place in the area to see the sunset.

                    A sunset cruise on Grace Bay can be an incredible way to watch the show as well, and is one of our
                    top recommended things to do.
                    <br>
                    Grace Bay Beach, and the adjacent coasts of Leeward Beach and the Bight Beach are very rarely
                    affected by sargassum and seaweed deposits. This is due to the typical east southeast wind
                    directions, which blow the floating offshore.

                    The Bight Beach has lush seagrass beds which grow in sheltered parts of the bay, and sometimes bits
                    of this seagrass does wash onto the beach. In most situations, if the seaweed is present, it’ll be a
                    narrow strip left at the high tide line.

                <p><span class="capital">W</span>hitehaven Beach is on Whitsunday Island, Australia. The island is
                    accessible by boat, seaplane & helicopter from Airlie Beach, as well as Hamilton Island. It lies
                    across from Stockyard Beach, better known as Chalkie's Beach, on Haslewood Island. The beach is
                    known for its crystal white silica sands and turquoise coloured waters. The beach has tour barbeque
                    and camping facilities.
                    <br>
                    The beach was awarded Queensland's Cleanest Beach in Keep Australia Beautiful's 2008 Beach Challenge
                    State Awards. In July 2010, Whitehaven Beach was named the top Eco Friendly Beach in the world by
                    CNN.com. Dogs are not permitted on the beach and cigarette smoking is prohibited.

                    Whitehaven Beach is known for its bright white sands, which consist of 98% pure silica. Local rocks
                    do not contain silica so it has been suggested that the sands were brought to the beach by
                    prevailing sea currents over millions of years.

                    Unlike regular sand, the sand on Whitehaven Beach does not retain heat making it comfortable to walk
                    barefoot on a hot day. This sand is also very fine, and can damage electronic equipment such as
                    telephones and cameras, although it is good at polishing up jewellery.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">T</span>ourists and locals visit Whitehaven Beach to swim and take in the
                    bright white sand. Some visitors eat a BBQ lunch, and campers can stay by booking the National Parks
                    camp facilities.

                    The Whitehaven Beach Ocean Swim is a 2 km open swimming competition held on the beach in November
                    each year since 2009 as part of the Hamilton Island Triathlon. The 2012 event was held on 11
                    November 2012. The beach was also featured in the racing video game Forza Horizon 3.

                    In 2018, the government announced an investment of $3.9 million for the construction of a new
                    long-distance walking track and upgrading of the camping areas on the Island to improve the holiday
                    experience of the visitors. The track will connect Whitehaven Beach to the Tongue Point.
                    <br>
                    Whitehaven Beach is protected by the Whitsunday Islands National Park, and is located in the heart
                    of the Great Barrier Reef. Australia’s most famous beach stretches for 4,4 miles (7 km) and is
                    washed by swirls of turquoise, blue and green water. The sand is 98% pure white silica, which gives
                    it a brilliant, near luminescent color. You can reach the beach via a helicopter or seaplane, or you
                    can sail to Whitehaven Beach with one of the many yacht excursions in the area.

                    of Fernando de Noronha, the main island of the archipelago located about 220 miles from the coast of
                    Brazil, belonging to the State of Pernambuco. It is a true earthly paradise with a favorable
                    temperate climate, and an extraordinary naturalistic oasis rich in flora and fauna, declared a
                    Marine National Park and included among the Unesco natural heritage sites for its spectacular
                    biodiversity. On the northeastern coast of the island, enclosed by verdant rocky walls bathed by the
                    crystalline waters of the Atlantic Ocean lies Baía do Sancho, the beautiful golden sand beach that
                    has been repeatedly noted as the "most beautiful beach in the world".

                    <br>
                    Baia do Sancho is an exclusive beach, a crescent of fine sand kissed by a sea with a splendid seabed
                    populated by colorful fish, dolphins, and sea turtles. A place with very few tourists, perhaps
                    because it is not really easy to reach considering that, to rest your feet on this beautiful sand,
                    you have a bit of an obstacle to overcome - you have to go down a steep iron staircase created
                    inside a rocky split, a vertical path so narrow that it allows only one person to pass at a time.
                    Alternatively, you can choose to rent a boat and reach the bay by sea.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">T</span>he Fernando de Noronha archipelago is made up of about 21 islets of
                    volcanic origin that represent the emerged part of an ancient submarine mountain range. Its wild and
                    unspoiled nature is protected by strict rules such as a maximum capacity of 700 daily tourists and
                    is subject to an entry fee known as an "environment tax" which costs $12 per person. The natural
                    beauty and environmental preservation of this destination, combined with its considerable distance
                    from the mainland coast, makes it one of the destinations furthest from mass tourism, but also one
                    of the least economical holidays in Brazil.

                    one speechless. The best example is Long Beach, the longest sandy beach on Canada’s Vancouver
                    Island, which offers eye-popping scenic views and an unmatched maritime wilderness. Located within
                    the boundaries of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve between Tofino and Ucluelet, its 10 miles
                    (16 km) of pristine sand are backed by lush rainforests and washed by a cool pounding surf.

                    <br>
                    Long Beach is the largest and longest beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on the west
                    coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. It is located on Wickaninnish Bay between
                    Tofino (NW) and Ucluelet (SE) and is adjoined by campgrounds and picnic areas. The Tofino-Ucluelet
                    highway parallels the entirety of the beach. The beach's consistent surf, exposed to the open
                    Pacific Ocean, established it as one of the earliest and most popular surfing locations in British
                    Columbia.

                    that are accessible only at low tide; when the tide is high, these islands are either surrounded by
                    water or thrashed by ocean swells. In addition, dangerous rip currents exist around the larger
                    islands, and to some extent in the open sea farther out. Unsupervised swimming is considered
                    extremely hazardous, and park visitors have been swept from shorebound rocks during storm season;
                    for this reason, beach access is restricted during heavy storm weather. Prominently posted signs
                    warn about the danger of visiting the beach during high tide, as shorebound logs can be shifted
                    unexpectedly by swells that wash onto the higher reaches of the beach.

                <p><span class="capital">K</span>o Phi Phi Le, 6.6 square kilometres (1,600 acres) in area,[2] is the
                    second largest island of the archipelago, the largest being Ko Phi Phi Don. The island consists of a
                    ring of steep limestone hills surrounding two shallow bays, Maya Bay and Loh Samah. During low tide,
                    Maya Bay cannot be accessed directly from the sea via boat, due to shallow waters and coral. Boats
                    must anchor at the deeper Loh Samah, requiring people to walk through a short section of rocks and
                    jungle to reach Maya Bay itself. There is also one large shallow fjord-like inlet called Pi Ley with
                    a small coral reef at the entrance. Maya Bay harbors bioluminescent plankton.

                    Hat Noppharat Thara-Mu Ko Phi Phi Marine National Park as a whole, from October 2015 to May 2016
                    generated revenues of 362 million baht from 1.2 million tourists, 77 percent foreign. As of 2019 the
                    park is closed to visitors because of environmental issues caused by overtourism.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">N</span>estled amidst 100 m high limestone cliffs, the clearest azure water,
                    and a beautiful blue sky, Maya Bay is a dream destination for every traveler. Famous for its
                    timeless beauty, it came to highlight after getting featured in the famous Hollywood movie Beach.

                    Situated in the Andaman Sea, Maya Bay lies in the Strait of Malacca in Krabi, Thailand. It comes
                    under the Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park and is now a preserved area. The bay
                    comprises several small beaches (visible only during low tides) with the major one being around a
                    200 m long stretch. Covered with silky soft powdery white sand and rich in underwater coral and
                    exotic fish, the bay is an unimaginably beautiful big reef.
                    <br>
                    Home to exotic coral reefs and beautiful colored fish, this place is a haven for marine life lovers.
                    It is amongst the most serene spots in Thailand to indulge in snorkeling or scuba diving. Paddling a
                    kayak over the crystal clear water is another not to be missed water sports activity here. Camping
                    at the beach is another adventure that you must try if you have the capacity to spend a night right
                    under the star-lit sky. Capturing the beautiful views of surroundings or clicking selfies with an
                    amazing backdrop of limestone cliff or majestic sea also leaves you with timeless memories.

                <p><span class="capital">C</span>amps Bay (Afrikaans: Kampsbaai) is an affluent suburb of Cape Town,
                    South Africa, and the small bay on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula after which it is named. In
                    summer it attracts many South African and foreign visitors.The first residents of Camps Bay were the
                    San (Hunter Gatherers) and the Goringqhaique, Khoi pastorates. When Jan van Riebeek established a
                    refreshment station for the VOC (Dutch East India Company), the Twelve Apostles were covered in
                    forests with lion, leopard and antelope.
                    <br>
                    Oudekraal is made up of a collection of tiny beaches sheltered amongst the boulders and a well
                    established picnic area with lawns, Braais, covered seating areas with tables, benches and public
                    toilets.

                    Lui Bay (also known as Witsand) is a popular dive site. In 1977 two scrap vessels, the Antipolis and
                    Romelia, were being towed around the cape when their tow line broke in a storm. This caused the
                    Antipolis to run aground near Oudekraal, while the Romelia foundered further south between Llandudno
                    and Sandy Bay. The hull of the Antipolis is now visible at low tide.

                    appears as an oven door in its side. There are several sheltered coves located in Bakoven. There is
                    a sea rescue base stationed here and a popular swimming beach is off Beta Close. In the early 1940s
                    a row of beach front houses were erected to house honored members of the South African Army who
                    fought during World War II. Many of these old houses still stand and are now registered as South
                    African National Heritage Sites.

                    Camps Bay Beach, a Blue Flag Beach since 2008, is the largest white sand beach in Camps Bay. There
                    is a seasonal life guard station with toilets at the west end of the beach. The beach is opposite
                    Camps Bay's main tourist hub, featuring multiple hotels, restaurants, and shops.

            <div class="main-content">
                <p><span class="capital">P</span>olihale Beach is by far the longest stretch of beach in the state of
                    Hawaii. Polihale Beach and State Park is located at the end of Highway 50 and is accessed down a
                    unpaved old cane haul road. The seventeen mile stretch of white sand beach and sand dunes offer
                    endless beach-combing and shelling fun. Polihale Beach sits at the end of NA PaliCoast and the edge
                    of the Mana Plains. This is a spectacular stretch of wilderness, with 100 foot sand dunes, desert
                    cactus and remarkable sunsets over the Forbidden Island of Niihau.

                    This is the last beach on the west side marks the beginning of the Napali Coast. Polihale Beach is
                    hot and shade is far from the waters edge, so don’t forget an umbrella and lots of water if you plan
                    on spending any time here.

                    Polihale Beach has some facilities and camping is by permit only. Strong currents and no lifeguard
                    make it is a notoriously dangerous beach for swimming. This is a great beach for shelling, long
                    beach walks and spectacular sunsets.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">P</span>olihale State Park is a remote wild beach on the western side of the
                    Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is the most western publicly accessible area in Hawaii, although the
                    privately owned island of Niihau is further west. The park is miles away from the town of Kekaha,
                    and it can only be reached via a poorly marked, dirt sugarcane road, making a four-wheel drive
                    vehicle preferable. The beach is several miles long, yet only the area known as "Queen's Pond"
                    offers safe swimming.
                    <br>
                    The park is located at the western end of Kauai and has many miles of shoreline that averages about
                    300 feet from the barrier dunes to the surf line. Sand dunes along the beach can reach heights
                    nearing 100 feet. Driving on the beach is permitted, but obtaining a tow truck would be expensive.

                <p><span class="capital">T</span>he absolutely breathtaking scenery is the real highlight of Anse Source
                    d’Argent. The mixture of shallow, clear water, golden sand, and imposing granite formations make it
                    one of the most picturesque beaches anywhere in the world, and one that’s well worth visiting for
                    anyone taking a holiday to the Seychelles.
                    <br>
                    Anse Source d’Argent, in the south-west of La Digue, has often been described as the most beautiful
                    beach in the world, and it is certainly one of the Seychelles’ most famous attractions. The
                    beautiful mix of turquoise water, golden sand, and impressive boulders makes it a unique prospect
                    worldwide. Access to Anse Source d’Argent is via the Union Estate, which charges 115 Rupees per
                    person each day for access, however the outcome is well-worth the fee.
                </p>
                <p><span class="capital">B</span>esides this initial entrance fee, access to the beach is easy thanks to
                    a number of well-signposted paths. One of the main reasons for the beach’s popularity, besides its
                    astounding beauty, is its variety of activities. The shallow, clear water, as well as the coral reef
                    protection, means the beach is a great spot for families, and is also perfect for swimming and
                    snorkelling. That said, it can be difficult to swim here at low tide, as the water is extremely
                    shallow, but at high tide, the water is deep enough to swim while still being shallow enough to be
                    safe for most swimmers.
                    <br>
                    The protection provided to the beach by the coral reef ensures that the open ocean feels far away,
                    so parents shouldn’t worry about their kids playing in the water. On top of that, the nearby
                    restaurants and fruit stands mean you can easily spend a whole day here if you like, although those
                    wanting the beach to themselves should arrive before 10.00. As mentioned, the beach is also famous
                    for having been used in a number of prominent photoshoots and films, including movies such as
                    Emanuelle, Crusoe, and Castaway, as well as the famous Bacardi adverts of the 1990s. Anse Source
                    d’Argent is truly a must-see for all Seychelles holidaymakers, and especially for those staying on
                    La Digue.
